% Notes: 
%        Plane waves are: Exp(1i*Kx.r'), Kx = [kx,ky,kz], r = [x,y,z].
%             The harmonic time is Exp(-1i*w t), and is suppressed.
%       The superstrate (z:: -inf:0) is linear, homogeneous, isotropic,
%             infinite half space, described by a real scalar index
%             of refraction: n1. 
%       The substrate (z:: T:+inf) [T = total grating thickness] is linear,
%            homogeneous, isotropic, infinite half-space described 
%            by a real/complex scalar index of refraction: n3.
%       Index of refractions are given in general as n + k*1i, where k>0
%            for absorbing materials.
%       Lamellar grating consisting of N layers, each layer has piecewise
%            constant index of refraction
%       The 'top' of the grating is at z = 0, at the interface of the
%            superstrate and grating. (+z point 'down' through the grating.)
%       The periodic direction of the grating defines the x-coordinate direction,
%            with right handed coordinate assumed. 
%       For TE, TM the plane of incidence is the x-z plane, thus for 
 %           TE, Ey is the only field component (y direction) of the E-field, and
 %           TM Hy is the only field component (y direction) of the H-field.

%% ================== Define properties for each grating layer here===============
                    % Grating properties here. Each layer is defined by a

                    % list must start with 0, and end with 1, with xi(n) <= xi(n+1);
